SLURM Overview
###############

The Skipjack Cluster uses **SLURM** (Simple Linux Universal Resource Manager) to manage resource scheduling, job submission, and execution across the cluster.

SLURM is a widely adopted, open-source workload manager developed by `SchedMD <https://slurm.schedmd.com/>`__. It supports large-scale high-performance computing environments and is used by national labs, supercomputing centers, and universities worldwide.

Overview
********

SLURM allows users to:

- Submit batch jobs using `sbatch`
- Monitor job status with `squeue`, `sacct`, or `scontrol`
- View the state of the cluster using `sinfo`
- Manage job arrays, resource requests, and job dependencies
- Allocate compute, memory, and GPU resources efficiently

All compute-intensive jobs must be submitted through SLURM. Running jobs directly on the login nodes is strictly prohibited. These nodes are shared among all users and are reserved for lightweight tasks like editing scripts, submitting jobs, and checking output files.

The Skipjack cluster places limits on the number of jobs queued and running on a per group (allocation) and partition basis. Please note that submitting a large number of jobs (especially very short ones) can impact the overall  scheduler response for all users. If you are anticipating submitting a lot of jobs, please contact `arch@jhu.edu <mailto:arch@jhu.edu>`__ before submission. We can work to check if there are bundling options (job arrays or gnu parallel) that make your workflow more efficient and reduce the impact on the scheduler.
